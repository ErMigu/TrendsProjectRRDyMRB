### 3. The Proposed E-mail-Based Phishing Attack Taxonomy
**Impression of an important event:** The information request leads to stress for the victim;
therefore, some victims do not analyze the e-mail with sufficient attention and proceed
with a hurry to execute the requested actions, providing the requested data.

***III. RELATED WORKS***
After the preliminary stages of the data mining process, the
choice of parameters and the choice of data set to be tested
will affect the performance of the model that will be visible in
the applications. For this reason, the result of the comparison
will depend on the chosen classification algorithm. The data
set (Table 1) used in this study is composed of the words that
have the most used spam mail feature today. Each word has its
own weight. These weights have been given a higher weight
on the words that will cause the person to feel excited, fearful
and hateful. In addition, these words are created with data
mining, existing harmful words and harmful content created
by the sites.

**IV. DEVELOPED APPLICATION**
In this study, an application called "Anti Phishing
Simulator" was developed to check the text content and
determine whether the related message contained phishing
elements. A simple flowchart of the implemented application
is given in Figure 2. Today, an e-mail can be found in
primitive ways whether it is a phishing message or not. For
this are looked where this e-mail came from, whether a link
with the message matches the actual website, whether the
email or referrer web site is using some emotional or exciting
words to get a response, whether it is spelling or grammar
errors in the email or on the website. However, many people
pay attention to this point unconsciously entering the links
given to others accounts. 

# Phishing Attacks: A Recent Comprehensive Study and a New Anatomy

INTRODUCTION

Greediness is another
human weakness that could be used by an attacker, for
example, emails that offering either great discounts, free gift
cards, and others (Workman, 2008).
Real-World Phishing Examples

Some real-world examples of phishing attacks are discussed in
this section to present the complexity of some recent phishing
attacks. Figure 2 shows the screenshot of a suspicious phishing
email that passed a University’s spam filters and reached the
recipient mailbox. As shown in Figure 2, the phisher uses the
sense of importance or urgency in the subject through the word
‘important,’ so that the email can trigger a psychological
reaction in the user to prompt them into clicking the
button “View message.” The email contains a suspicious
embedded button, indeed, when hovering over this
embedded button, it does not match with Uniform Resource
Locator (URL) in the status bar. Another clue in this example is
that the sender’s address is questionable and not known to the
receiver. Clicking on the fake attachment button will result in
either installation of a virus or worm onto the computer or
handing over the user’s credentials by redirecting the victim
onto a fake login page.


More recently, phishers take advantage of the Coronavirus
pandemic (COVID-19) to fool their prey. Many Coronavirusthemed scam messages sent by attackers exploited people’s fear of
contracting COVID-19 and urgency to look for information
related to Coronavirus (e.g., some of these attacks are related
to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as facemasks), the
WHO stated that COVID-19 has created an Infodemic which is favorable for phishers (Hewage, 2020). 

PHISHING DEFINITIONS

Various definitions for the term “phishing” have been proposed
and discussed by experts, researchers, and cybersecurity
institutions. Although there is no established definition for the
term “phishing” due to its continuous evolution, this term has been
defined in numerous ways based on its use and context. The
process of tricking the recipient to take the attacker’s desired action
is considered the de facto definition of phishing attacks in general.
Some definitions name websites as the only possible medium to
conduct attacks. The study (Merwe et al., 2005, p. 1) defines
phishing as “a fraudulent activity that involves the creation of a
replica of an existing web page to fool a user into submitting
personal, financial, or password data.” The above definition
describes phishing as an attempt to scam the user into revealing
sensitive information such as bank details and credit card numbers,
by sending malicious links to the user that leads to the fake web
establishment. Others name emails as the only attack vector. For
instance, PishTank (2006) defines phishing as “a fraudulent
